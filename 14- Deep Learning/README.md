# Evaluation 

## Which model has a lower loss? 

#### The LSTM Stock Predictor Fear and Greed Code has a lower loss of 0.02 vs. 0.08. 

## Which model tracks the actual values better over time? 

#### LSTM Stock Predictor Closing tracks the actual values better over time.

## Which window size works best for the model? 

#### In both instances I used a window size of 10 and that worked well for the model.
